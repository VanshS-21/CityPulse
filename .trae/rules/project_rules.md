## Glassmorphism Usage Guideline

To create a modern, sophisticated and visually appealing urban intelligence interface, all UI
components and layout sections should leverage the glassmorphism style where appropriate.

This includes:

- Using translucent background with backdrop blur for UI containers like cards, modals, popovers,
  and sidebars.
- Employing subtle light reflections and shadow glows to emphasize interactive UI elements.
- Ensuring sufficient contrast and legibility when applying glass effects.
- Following the color palette defined in the Urban Intelligence design tokens to maintain
  consistency.
- Considering performance and accessibility implications when implementing glass effects.

Reference the `.citypulse-glass` utility class for implementation, which applies the standard blur,
translucent background and subtle outline & shadow glow.

This rule ensures a consistent, high-tech professional appearance across the CityPulse platform.
