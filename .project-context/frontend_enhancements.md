This document details the improvements and best practices applied to the CityPulse frontend codebase.

## 1. Refactoring Form Submissions with Server Actions

**Date:** 2025-07-05

### Change Description

The `Submit Report` page (`src/app/submit-report/page.tsx`) was refactored to use a **Server Action** for form handling, replacing the traditional client-side submission logic. This change aligns the application with the latest features and best practices introduced in Next.js 15 and React 19.

- An `actions.ts` file was created to house the `submitReport` server function.
- The form component now uses the `useFormState` hook from `react-dom` to manage form state (e.g., success messages, errors) in a declarative way.
- The `<form>` element's `action` attribute is directly bound to the server action.

### Rationale & Benefits

This refactoring was based on the findings in the `best_practices_research.md` document and provides several key advantages:

1.  **Enhanced Security**: Server Actions are designed to be more secure. Unused actions are automatically stripped from the client bundle, and the IDs used to invoke them are unguessable and periodically regenerated, reducing the attack surface.
2.  **Improved User Experience**: By using `useFormState`, we can provide immediate feedback to the user upon submission without a full page reload, leading to a smoother experience.
3.  **Simplified Code**: This approach reduces the amount of client-side JavaScript needed to manage form state and submission, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable component.
4.  **Modern Best Practices**: Adopting Server Actions ensures the CityPulse frontend is built with the latest, officially recommended patterns for data mutation in Next.js.
