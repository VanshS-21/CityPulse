# Security Report

This report details the findings from the `bandit` security analysis of the Python codebase.

## Summary

No high-severity security issues were identified. The scan flagged the use of `assert` statements in test files, which is a low-severity issue and is standard practice for testing. It does not pose a security risk in a production environment.

## Detailed Bandit Output
