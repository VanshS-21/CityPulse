Perform comprehensive code analysis to understand structure, quality, and potential improvements:

1. **Static Analysis:**
   - Run linting tools (ESLint, Pylint, etc.)
   - Check code style and formatting
   - Identify potential bugs and issues
   - Analyze code complexity metrics

2. **Architecture Review:**
   - Analyze project structure
   - Review design patterns implementation
   - Assess separation of concerns
   - Evaluate scalability and maintainability

3. **Dependency Analysis:**
   - Review package dependencies
   - Check for security vulnerabilities
   - Analyze dependency versions
   - Identify unused or outdated packages

4. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Analyze memory usage patterns
   - Review database query efficiency
   - Assess caching strategies

5. **Security Assessment:**
   - Review authentication mechanisms
   - Check for common vulnerabilities
   - Analyze data validation
   - Review access control implementation

6. **Test Coverage Analysis:**
   - Review test coverage metrics
   - Identify untested code paths
   - Assess test quality and effectiveness
   - Plan test improvements

7. **Documentation Review:**
   - Assess code documentation quality
   - Review README and setup instructions
   - Check API documentation completeness
   - Identify documentation gaps

8. **Recommendations:**
   - Prioritize improvement areas
   - Create action plan for issues
