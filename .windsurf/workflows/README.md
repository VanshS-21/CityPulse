## 📋 Best Practices

### **Before Starting Any Workflow**
1. **Backup your code** - Ensure you have a clean git state
2. **Read the entire workflow** - Understand all steps before beginning
3. **Prepare your environment** - Ensure all tools and dependencies are available
4. **Set aside adequate time** - Don't rush through complex workflows

### **During Workflow Execution**
1. **Follow steps sequentially** - Don't skip steps unless explicitly noted
2. **Document your progress** - Keep notes of decisions and changes
3. **Test frequently** - Validate changes at each major step
4. **Ask for help** - Don't hesitate to seek assistance when needed

### **After Workflow Completion**
1. **Generate reports** - Document what was accomplished
2. **Update documentation** - Reflect any changes made
3. **Share learnings** - Contribute improvements back to the workflow
4. **Plan next steps** - Identify follow-up actions or workflows
