Design and implement database schema for the application:

1. **Schema Design:**
   - Design normalized database schema
   - Define entity relationships
   - Plan data types and constraints
   - Consider scalability requirements

2. **Migration Setup:**
   - Create migration scripts
   - Set up version control for schema
   - Plan rollback strategies
   - Test migration procedures

3. **Indexing Strategy:**
   - Identify query patterns
   - Create appropriate indexes
   - Optimize for read/write balance
   - Monitor index performance

4. **Data Integrity:**
   - Implement foreign key constraints
   - Set up check constraints
   - Configure triggers if needed
   - Ensure data consistency

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Optimize table structures
   - Implement partitioning if needed
   - Set up connection pooling
   - Monitor query performance

6. **Backup and Recovery:**
   - Set up automated backups
   - Test recovery procedures
   - Document backup schedules
   - Plan disaster recovery

Ensure database design supports application requirements efficiently.
