# Testing Verification Report

This report summarizes the results of the comprehensive testing verification phase.

## 1. Frontend Unit Tests (Jest)

*   **Status:** ✅ PASS
*   **Summary:** The Jest test suite was executed successfully. All 3 test suites, containing a total of 4 tests, passed without any errors.

## 2. Frontend End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

*   **Status:** ✅ PASS
*   **Summary:** The Playwright end-to-end test suite was executed successfully. All 1 tests passed, confirming that the user submission flow is working as expected.

## 3. Backend Python Tests (Pytest)

*   **Status:** ❌ BLOCKED
*   **Summary:** The Pytest suite for the backend could not be executed due to persistent and unresolvable Python dependency conflicts.
*   **Details:** Multiple attempts to install the required packages from `requirements.txt` failed, even within a dedicated virtual environment. The primary issue appears to be an incompatibility between the project's dependencies (specifically `numpy` and `apache-beam`) and the build tooling (`setuptools`) for the installed Python version (3.13). The recurring error during the package build process was `AttributeError: module 'pkgutil' has no attribute 'ImpImporter'`, which points to a deep-seated environmental problem. All attempts to mitigate this by adjusting dependency versions, upgrading `pip`, and explicitly installing build tools were unsuccessful.

## Conclusion

The frontend of the CityPulse application is stable and has passed all unit and end-to-end tests. However, the stability of the backend could not be verified through its automated test suite due to significant environmental issues. It is recommended that the Python environment and dependency list be investigated and resolved before deployment.
