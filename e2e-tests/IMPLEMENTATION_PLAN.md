# CityPulse E2E Testing Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for the CityPulse E2E testing framework. The framework is
designed to be adaptive, maintainable, and aligned with the current backend-first development approach.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Implemented and Ready for Testing

#### Backend APIs (Python/FastAPI)

-  Events API: Full CRUD operations with authentication
-  Users API: Profile management and role-based access
-  Feedback API: User feedback collection and processing
-  Analytics API: KPIs, trends, and location-based analytics
-  Authentication: Firebase Auth with role-based permissions

#### Data Pipeline

-  Apache Beam/Dataflow integration
-  Pub/Sub messaging system
-  BigQuery data storage
-  AI processing capabilities

#### Frontend (Minimal)

-  Next.js API routes forwarding to backend
-  Basic authentication middleware
-  Placeholder UI components

### 🧹 Legacy Test Issues Identified

#### Assessment Results

-  6 test directories found with scattered organization
-  11 redundant test groups requiring consolidation
-  Tests spread across `tests/`, `**tests**/`, and `tests/e2e-legacy/`-  Mixed Jest and pytest configurations

#### Recommendations

1.  Consolidate redundant test groups
1.  Migrate valuable tests from legacy directories
1.  Unify test configurations
1.  Implement automated relevance checking
