		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Core Google Cloud Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of setting up core Google Cloud infrastructure into specific steps for each required service and foundational elements like project creation and IAM.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves provisioning multiple distinct GCP services and configuring basic access controls. While foundational, it requires knowledge across several areas of GCP, making it moderately complex. Breaking it down by service ensures each component is addressed systematically."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define and Implement Core Data Models",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of defining and implementing core data models by the database type and specific schema, including considerations for structure, data types, and performance features like partitioning/clustering.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires translating abstract schemas into concrete database structures for two different database types (BigQuery and Firestore). It's moderately complex due to the need to understand the nuances of each database and optimize for the intended use cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Data Ingestion Pipelines",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of implementing basic data ingestion pipelines by source and destination, including steps for Pub/Sub setup, Dataflow development (reading, transforming, writing), and testing for each pipeline.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing data pipelines, especially with a framework like Dataflow involving multiple sources, transformations, and sinks, is inherently complex. It requires careful design, coding, testing, and deployment of distributed jobs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Core Backend APIs",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of developing core backend APIs by resource (Events, Users) and functionality (CRUD), including steps for framework setup, endpoint implementation, database interaction logic, and basic authentication/authorization.",
			"reasoning": "Developing multiple API endpoints that interact with different databases and include basic authentication adds significant complexity. It requires backend development skills, database interaction logic, and security considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build Basic Web Frontend (Map & Reporting)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of building the basic web frontend by feature, including steps for project setup, map integration, data fetching and display, form implementation, API integration for reporting, and deployment.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating multiple frontend technologies and external APIs (Google Maps), fetching and displaying dynamic data, and building interactive forms. It's moderately complex due to the combination of different components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Mobile App Framework & Basic Reporting UI",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of setting up the mobile app and basic reporting UI by platform setup, UI components, device feature integration (camera, location), and API integration for form submission.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a cross-platform mobile project and integrating device-specific features like camera and location adds complexity beyond a simple UI build. It requires understanding the mobile framework and native integrations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Basic AI Processing (Text/Image)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of integrating basic AI processing by the type of AI analysis (text, image) and the integration point within the data pipeline, including steps for API calls, response handling, and storing results.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating external AI APIs into an existing data processing flow is complex. It requires handling API requests/responses, potential errors, latency, and ensuring the processed data is correctly structured and stored."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Event Clustering, Categorization & Sentiment",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of implementing event clustering, categorization, and sentiment analysis by the specific logic/feature, including steps for algorithm design, implementation, integration into the data flow, and validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves developing and integrating complex logic (clustering algorithms, refined categorization rules) and integrating advanced NLP/AI processing (sentiment analysis). Algorithmic development and complex data processing make this highly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Real-Time Dashboard Updates",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of developing real-time dashboard updates by component, including steps for setting up the real-time backend (e.g., WebSocket server), implementing data subscription logic, developing the frontend client, and updating specific UI elements (map, KPIs).",
			"reasoning": "Implementing real-time data synchronization is a complex undertaking involving backend architecture design (WebSockets), managing state, and ensuring efficient and reliable data flow to the frontend. It adds significant architectural and development overhead."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Preferences & Basic Alerting",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of implementing user preferences and basic alerting by component, including steps for data model extension, API development for preferences, backend logic for checking preferences and triggering notifications, and mobile app integration for receiving notifications.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple system components (database, API, backend logic, mobile app) and requires implementing conditional processing based on user preferences to trigger external actions (push notifications). The distributed nature adds complexity."
