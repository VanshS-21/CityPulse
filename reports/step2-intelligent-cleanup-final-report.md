**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Consolidated dependency management
- ✅ Enhanced `.gitignore` with comprehensive patterns
- ✅ Standardized virtual environment exclusions

### 4. **File and Directory Organization** ✅

**Current Structure Assessment:**
```
✅ EXCELLENT organization maintained:
├── src/                    # Next.js frontend (clean)
├── data_models/           # Python data processing (optimized)
├── infra/                 # Terraform infrastructure (organized)
├── tests/                 # Comprehensive testing (clean)
├── docs/                  # Complete documentation (excellent)
├── E2E/                   # End-to-end testing (cleaned)
└── scripts/               # Automation utilities (maintained)
```

**Cleanup Actions:**
- ✅ Removed empty directories
- ✅ Cleaned cache and temporary files
- ✅ Maintained excellent existing organization

### 5. **Dependency Management** ✅

**Before Cleanup:**
```
requirements.txt:
- Main dependencies: ✅ Good
- Testing dependencies: ❌ Duplicated
- Total lines: 49

requirements-test.txt:
- Comprehensive testing framework: ✅ Excellent
- Total lines: 190
```

**After Cleanup:**
```
requirements.txt:
- Main dependencies only: ✅ Clean
- No duplicate testing deps: ✅ Fixed
- Total lines: 43 (reduced by 6 lines)

requirements-test.txt:
- Single source of truth for testing: ✅ Maintained
- Comprehensive coverage: ✅ Excellent
```

### 6. **Documentation Cleanup** ✅

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive and well-organized
- ✅ No duplicate or outdated documentation found
- ✅ Recent comprehensive documentation audit completed
- ✅ All documentation follows consistent standards

**Status:** No cleanup needed - documentation is exemplary

### 7. **Infrastructure Cleanup** ✅

**Findings:**
- Temporary secret creation directory in `infra/temp_secret_creation/`
- Terraform state files properly managed
- Infrastructure configuration well-organized

**Recommendations:**
- Consider archiving `infra/temp_secret_creation/` if no longer needed
- Terraform state files are properly excluded in `.gitignore`
