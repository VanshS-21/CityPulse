# File Deletion Log

This log tracks all files deleted during the redundancy cleanup process.

## Step 1: Removing files from data/backups/reports/

Date: 2025-07-07
Reason: Identical versions exist in reports/

Files to be deleted:
- apache-beam-pipeline-deployment-report.md
- architecture-enhancement-recommendations.md
- architecture-review-report.md
- code-review-preparation-summary.md
- codebase-integration-and-cohesion-analysis.md
- deep-project-analysis-and-understanding.md
- documentation-audit-report.md
- documentation-cleanup-and-reorganization-report.md
- performance-optimization-report.md
- redundancy-cleanup-report.md

**Status: COMPLETED** - All 10 files successfully removed from data/backups/reports/

## Step 2: Scanning docs/ and reports/ for duplicates and outdated files

### Duplicate Analysis Results
- **MD5 Hash Comparison**: No exact duplicates found between docs/ and reports/ directories
- **Documentation Audit Reports**: Two separate audit reports found but determined to be complementary (before/after states)
  - `documentation-audit-report.md` (8,109 bytes) - Initial audit identifying issues
  - `comprehensive-documentation-audit-july-2025.md` (10,444 bytes) - Final completion report

### Large Temporary Files Identified for Removal
- **File**: `reports/pre-cleanup-inventory.csv` (16,873,681 bytes)
- **File**: `reports/pre-cleanup-inventory.md` (10,282,206 bytes)
- **Reason**: These are temporary inventory files generated before cleanup, no longer needed
- **Total Size**: 25.9 MB to be reclaimed

**Status: COMPLETED** - Large temporary inventory files successfully removed

### Summary of Step 2 Results
- ✅ No exact duplicates found between docs/ and reports/
- ✅ Documentation audit reports retained (complementary, not duplicates)
- ✅ Removed 2 large temporary files (25.9 MB space reclaimed)
- ✅ All remaining files in docs/ and reports/ are unique and current
