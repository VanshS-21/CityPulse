## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these steps. For more detailed instructions, see the [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v18+)
-   Python (v3.11+)
-   Terraform (v1.0+)
-   Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`)

### 1. Provision Infrastructure
All cloud resources are managed by Terraform. See the **[Infrastructure Setup Guide](./infra/README.md)** for instructions.

### 2. Setup Backend
The backend data pipelines require a specific Python environment. See the **[Data Models & Backend Guide](./data_models/README.md)**.

### 3. Run Frontend
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.
