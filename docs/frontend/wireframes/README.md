## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
```typescript
// Frontend Framework
Next.js 15.3.4 with App Router
React 19.1.0 with TypeScript

// UI Components
shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens

// State Management
Zustand for client state
React Query for server state

// Animation
Framer Motion for complex animations
CSS transitions for simple interactions

// Maps & Location
Google Maps JavaScript API
Geolocation API for GPS features

// Authentication
Firebase Auth with role-based access
```

### Design Tokens Integration
```typescript
// Using existing design tokens from src/styles/tokens.ts
import { colors, typography, spacing, borderRadius } from '@/styles/tokens'

// Glassmorphism utilities
const glassStyles = {
  background: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)',
  backdropFilter: 'blur(20px)',
  border: '1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)',
  borderRadius: borderRadius.xl,
  boxShadow: '0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
}
```

### Performance Targets
- **Initial Load**: < 2 seconds
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3 seconds
- **Animation Performance**: 60fps maintained
- **Bundle Size**: < 200KB initial load
- **Lighthouse Score**: > 90 all categories

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactions
- **Screen Reader**: Comprehensive ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user motion preferences

### Testing Strategy
```typescript
// Automated accessibility testing
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe'

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations)

test('should not have accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Component />)
  const results = await axe(container)
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
})
```

---

## üì± Responsive Design

### Breakpoint Strategy
```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
.component {
  /* Mobile styles (320px+) */
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Tablet styles */
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* Desktop styles */
}

@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  /* Large desktop styles */
}
```

### Mobile Optimizations
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe actions and pull-to-refresh
- **Performance**: Optimized for 3G networks
- **Offline Support**: Service worker for basic functionality

## üé≠ Animation Guidelines

### Motion Principles
- **Purposeful**: Every animation serves a functional purpose
- **Performant**: GPU-accelerated transforms for smooth 60fps
- **Accessible**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- **Consistent**: Unified timing and easing across components

### Animation Timing
```typescript
export const animationConfig = {
  fast: { duration: 0.15, ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] },
  normal: { duration: 0.3, ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] },
  slow: { duration: 0.5, ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] },
  spring: { type: 'spring', stiffness: 300, damping: 30 }
}
```

## üìù Notes for Developers

### Getting Started
1. Review the component library specifications first
2. Set up the design system with glassmorphism utilities
3. Implement components in order of dependency
4. Test accessibility at each step
5. Optimize performance continuously

### Key Considerations
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for UI state, React Query for server state
- **Animation Performance**: Always use transform properties for animations
- **Accessibility**: Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **Mobile Experience**: Design for touch-first interactions
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle size and Core Web Vitals

These wireframes provide a comprehensive foundation for building a modern, accessible, and performant urban intelligence platform that meets the highest standards of contemporary web design.
