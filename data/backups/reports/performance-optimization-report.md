### **BigQuery Optimizations**

#### **Partitioning Strategy**
```sql
-- Time-based partitioning with automatic expiration
PARTITION BY DATE(created_at)
OPTIONS (
  partition_expiration_days = 90,
  require_partition_filter = true
)
```

#### **Clustering Configuration**

-- Multi-column clustering for optimal query performance
CLUSTER BY location_hash, category, priority
```

#### **Materialized View for Dashboards**

-- Auto-refreshing materialized view for dashboard metrics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW events_daily_summary_mv AS
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as event_date,
  category,
  priority,
  COUNT(*) as event_count,
  COUNTIF(priority = 'critical') as critical_events,
  AVG(ai_analysis.urgency_score) as avg_urgency_score
FROM events_optimized
WHERE created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
```

### **Apache Beam Optimizations**

#### **Adaptive Windowing**
```python
# Dynamic window sizing based on data volume
def create_adaptive_window(data_volume_threshold=1000):
    if data_volume_threshold > 1000:
        return window.FixedWindows(30)  # High volume: smaller windows
    else:
        return window.FixedWindows(120)  # Low volume: larger windows
```

#### **Batched Processing**
```python
# Batched AI processing for external API optimization
class BatchedAIProcessor(BatchedAPIProcessor):
    def __init__(self, batch_size=50):
        super().__init__(batch_size)
    
    def process_batch(self, batch):
        # Process entire batch in single API call
        return self.ai_service.analyze_batch(batch)
```

### **Frontend Optimizations**

```typescript
// Intelligent caching with TTL and deduplication
async request<T>(endpoint: string, options: RequestOptions = {}) {
  const cacheKey = `${endpoint}_${JSON.stringify(options)}`;
  
  // Check cache first
  if (options.cache && this.isCacheValid(cacheKey)) {
    return this.cache.get(cacheKey);
  }
  
  // Deduplication: check if request is already in progress
  if (this.requestQueue.has(cacheKey)) {
    return await this.requestQueue.get(cacheKey);
  }
  
  // Execute request with retry logic
  const result = await this.executeWithRetry(endpoint, options);
  
  // Cache successful responses
  if (options.cache && result.success) {
    this.cache.set(cacheKey, result);
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

#### **State Management Optimization**
```typescript
// Granular state management with selective subscriptions
export const useDashboardStore = create<DashboardState>()(
  subscribeWithSelector(
    immer((set, get) => ({
      // Separate state slices for optimal performance
      metrics: initialMetrics,
      filters: initialFilters,
      ui: initialUI,
      reports: initialReports,
      
      // Optimized actions with batch updates
      updateMetrics: (metrics) => set((state) => {
        Object.assign(state.metrics, metrics);
        state.metrics.lastUpdated = new Date().toISOString();
      })
    }))
